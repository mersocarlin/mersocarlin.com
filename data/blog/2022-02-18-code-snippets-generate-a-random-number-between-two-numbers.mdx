This is another blog post I write about code snippets I find useful.
Below is the list of the previous code snippets I have written about:

- [Sort array of objects by a property in JavaScript](/blog/code-snippets-sort-array-of-objects-by-a-property-in-javascript)
- [Unique array in JavaScript](/blog/code-snippets-unique-array)
- [Pre-populate an array in JavaScript](/blog/code-snippets-pre-populate-an-array-in-javascript)
- [uniqueId](/blog/code-snippets-uniqueid)

Today's code snippet is about how to generate a random number between two numbers in JavaScript.

I usually go for this snippet in two main scenarios:

- When prototyping a UI without an endpoint: I like to randomize stats so I don't always get to see the same results over and over.
- Unit tests so I don't create biased tests: this is how I ensure reliability for tests that need some sort of number input.
It's also helpful when I need to quickly create an array and its size doesn't really matter much.

[Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) gets us halfway through there: it returns a floating-point number between 0 and 1 (exclusive).

The next step is to use `Math.random` so it returns the number within the desired range:

```ts
/**
 * Generates a random number between @min (inclusive) and @max (exclusive)
 */
 function generateRandomNumber(min: number, max: number) {
  Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min)
}
```

Should you need to a random number that could also be equal to `max` we'd have to add a `+ 1` to the difference between `max` and `min`:

```ts
/**
 * Generates a random number between @min (inclusive) and @max (inclusive)
 */
 function generateRandomNumber(min: number, max: number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
}
```


I hope that's helpful and interesting to you. üëãüèº
