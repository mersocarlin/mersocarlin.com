Sharing my top Visual Studio Code extensions in 2021.

## Theme

- Icons: [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)

I have also setup custom colors in `workbench.colorCustomizations`:

## Extensions

### Prettier

[Prettier in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Opinionated code formatter that automatically formats code for you.

I have a setting on in my VS code to always format a file when I save it so I don't have to worry about formatting the code myself which is a bit of pain and time consuming.

It's really helpful if you're learning to code as it forces you into good coding practices.

This is the setting I use that autoformats a file on save:

```json
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
"[typescript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
"[typescriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
},
```

### GitLens

[GitLens in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

Git features in VS Code.
The feature I use every day is the ability to see a live blame on the line I'm currently in.

Super useful when working with other people on the team as you can quickly see who has changed the code, when that line was changed/added as well as the commit message.

### Live Share

[Live Share in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)

> It's like Google Docs, but for code.

Great extension to do pair programming.
Everyone on the session can modify, see the same file and work on the same project side by side.

I've been using this extension a lot lately with my team members.
Zoom call + VS Code Live Share and we're ready for a virtual pair programming üôåüèº.

### Quokka

[Quokka in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode)

Fast JS/TS prototyping tool.
I'm constantly looking for quick code validations to test methods, check its output, `console.log`...

What I like most about it is that I don't have to leave VS Code in order to validate whether a JS snippet I'm about to write is going to work or not.

### Auto Close Tag

[Auto Close Tag in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

Very handy for HTML or JSX/TSX syntax.
It became so automatic that I rarely need to close a `div`, `p`, `a` or `span` tags.

### Better Comments

[Better Comments in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

Highlights various types of comments in the code.

### Settings Sync

[Settings Sync in Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)

Keep the same VS Code configuration (themes, colors, extensions, snippets...) across multiple machines.
I can easily save & update my settings with a single command in VS Code.

I hope that's helpful and interesting to you. üëãüèº
