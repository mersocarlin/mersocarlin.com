I recently had to remove `underscore` from a repository I was working on and I end up using some small tweaks with plain JS syntax instead.
I have to say this is not the first time I do a similar job and I always use the same utility methods here and there.

For that reason, I'm gonna share some of those in my blog for future reference whenever I need one of them again.

It could be you came here for the same reason as me. We'd better share that knowledge 😉

## uniqueId

Generates a unique global id for elements that need one. 

Examples:

- Setting `key` property when looping an array in ReactJS (_watchout for potential performance issues if going this path!_).
- Setting `id` attribute to DOM elements.
- Cache response from endpoints that don't provide you with an identifier.

As a [curried function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying), it keeps a local `counter` variable and for every new `uniqueId` generated `counter`'s value is incremented.
An optional `prefix` can also be sent in case you want some extra information alongside with the id.


```js
function createUniqueId() {
  let counter = 0

  return (prefix = '') => {
    if (prefix) {
      return `${prefix}_${++counter}`
    }

    return `${++counter}`
  }
}

const uniqueId = createUniqueId()

console.log(uniqueId()) // 1
console.log(uniqueId()) // 2
console.log(uniqueId()) // 3
console.log(uniqueId('testing')) // testing_4
```

I hope that's helpful and interesting to you. 👋🏼
