This is the second post I write about code snippets I find useful (you can check the first one [here](/blog/code-snippets-uniqueid)).
And today's code snippet is how to pre-populate an array in JavaScript.

The `for` loop is probably one of the first choices that comes to mind when dealing with arrays or collections.
But instead, I prefer to create an array with [Array.from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).

If you've never heard of `Array.from` before, it accepts and array-like or an iteratable object as its first argument so we can map into it.
Once the array is created, `map` gives us each element in the newly created array so we can populate it with, for example, the index of each element.


```js
function createArray(size) {
  return Array.from({ length: size }).map((_, index) => index + 1)
}
```

or using the Array constructor:


```js
function createArray(size) {
  return Array.from(Array(size)).map((_, index) => index + 1)
}
```
