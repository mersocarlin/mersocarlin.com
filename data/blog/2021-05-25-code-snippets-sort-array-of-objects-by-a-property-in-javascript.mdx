This is another blog post I write about code snippets I find useful.
Below is the list of the previous code snippets I have written about:

- [Unique array in JavaScript](/blog/code-snippets-unique-array)
- [Pre-populate an array in JavaScript](/blog/code-snippets-pre-populate-an-array-in-javascript)
- [uniqueId](/blog/code-snippets-uniqueid)

Today's code snippet is about how to sort and array of objects by a property in JavaScript.

Arrays in JavaScript have a built-in [sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method to sort items in ascending order.
However, that quite doesn't work out of the box if we'd like to sort an array of integers or objects:

```ts
const strArray = ['typescript', 'javascript', 'reactjs', 'nodejs']
strArray.sort()
console.log(strArray) // ["javascript", "nodejs", "reactjs", "typescript"] ✅

const numberArray = [1, 10, 2, 100, 3, 1000]
numberArray.sort()
console.log(numberArray) // [1, 10, 100, 1000, 2, 3] ❌

const objectArray = [
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 3, 28),
    title: 'Treat Test Code as Production Code',
  },
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 10),
    title: 'To-do lists, checkboxes and the definition of done',
  },
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 17),
    title: 'Planning the integration of tags in my blog posts',
  },
]
objectArray.sort()
console.log(objectArray)
/**
 [
  {
     date: Wed Apr 28 2021 00:00:00,
     title: 'Treat Test Code as Production Code'
  }, 
  {
    date: Mon May 10 2021 00:00:00, 
    title: 'To-do lists, checkboxes and the definition of done'
  }, 
  {
    date: Mon May 17 2021 00:00:00, 
    title: 'Planning the integration of tags in my blog posts'
  }
] ❌
*/
```

The reason why `numberArray` and `objectArray` are not property sorted is because the `sort` method converts elements to strings and then compares the elements in the array.

This is why all items that start with `1` come first in `numberArray`.

The good news is that we can still sort items in the array the way we want.
Especially for `objectArray` where we can sort it by either `title` or `date` properties.
I actually use this to sort blog posts in my blog and you can see the code [right here](https://github.com/mersocarlin/mersocarlin.com/blob/43c3dd6bfbea91a2da613be8b471b3da9932bb97/src/utils/posts.ts#L5).

The `sort` method takes a callback function with 2 arguments we can use to create our custom comparison.
The rule of thumb I use is:

- return `1` if I want to sort items ascending
- return `-1` if I want to sort items descending

We can also extract the compare function for reusability:

```ts
const numberArray = [1, 10, 2, 100, 3, 1000]
numberArray.sort((itemA, itemB) => (itemA > itemB ? 1 : -1))
console.log(numberArray) // [1, 2, 3, 10, 100, 1000] ✅

const objectArray = [
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 3, 28),
    title: 'Treat Test Code as Production Code',
  },
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 10),
    title: 'To-do lists, checkboxes and the definition of done',
  },
  {
    date: new Date(2021, 4, 17),
    title: 'Planning the integration of tags in my blog posts',
  },
]

function sortByName(blogPostA, blogPostB) {
  return blogPostA.title > blogPostB.title ? 1 : -1
}

objectArray.sort(sortByName)
/**
 [
   {
     date: Mon May 17 2021 00:00:00, 
     title: 'Planning the integration of tags in my blog posts'
   }
   {
     date: Mon May 10 2021 00:00:00, 
     title: 'To-do lists, checkboxes and the definition of done'
    }, 
    {
       date: Wed Apr 28 2021 00:00:00,
       title: 'Treat Test Code as Production Code'
    }, 
] ✅
*/
```

I hope that's helpful and interesting to you. 👋🏼
