I started [last year's review blog post](/blog/2020-in-review) by mentioning that 2020 was very unusual to all of us.
It turned out that in 2021 this _"unusual"_ sort of became my new normal.

And after another full year of working from home, these were my top milestones in 2021.

## Vaccinated

I‚Äôve got my COVID vaccine in ~~two~~ three shots.
Two in mid 2021 and the booster shot in December.
Needless to say I believe in this and I hope we can all put an end to this pandemic for good really soon.

## Fatherhood

The amazing experience of being a father continues. 
And same as last year I keep learning day by day, sleep routine is key (_but hard to manage_) and I still think that fixing a bug in production is easier than putting a 21 months old baby to sleep.

What has changed from then and now? 
Words everywhere! I can‚Äôt describe how awesome it is to see the first words coming out.
Especially when they are followed by _"daddy"_ or _"mommy"_ ü•∞.

## Met with my family for the first time in 2 years

...and also went back to Brazil for the first time in 3 years!

Some of the choices we make in life can directly affect others.
And by choosing to [live in Ireland](/blog/2020-in-review#irish-life) has distantiated me from my parents.

What‚Äôs worse than that? Pandemic!
It was not only impossible to meet with my parents but it also prevented them from meeting their first grandchild.

In 2021, my son met his grandparents, the family is happy, everyone is super spoiled and social distance is still a thing.


## New team, new mission 

I‚Äôm the Technical Lead of a new team in 2021.
Challenges and responsibility have grown exponentially and the impact of our work is big too.
I‚Äôm fortunate enough to be working with a good and smart bunch which helps me move things quickly.

If you're currently working with me and is reading this blog post, I'm super thankful to be working with you! üôåüèº

On a personal note, I‚Äôm still a shy person.
The difference is that I really don‚Äôt mind talking to people I‚Äôve never met before anymore.

## Audiobooks

Books (or audiobooks) are an important part of who I am.
[I‚Äôve read less books in 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021) when compared to 2020 (18 last year, 13 this year) but I can highlight and recommend a few good ones:

- [Influence, New and Expanded: The Psychology of Persuasion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56419468-influence-new-and-expanded)
- [The Culture Map](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22085568-the-culture-map)
- [The Honest Truth About Dishonesty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13426114-the-honest-truth-about-dishonesty)
- [Creativity, Inc.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc)
- [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45303387-an-elegant-puzzle)
- [Black Buck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53091994-black-buck)

## Working from Home

This is certainly one of my "new normal" and I don‚Äôt see myself going to the office on a daily basis anymore.

Working from home has made me very productive and it also gives me the opportunity to see my son growing.

Having a dedicated space for work and work only is important and that makes it easier for me to avoid distractions around me.
I‚Äôd probably have a different opinion if working from the living room or from the kitchen every day with lots of distractions, especially when there‚Äôs a toddler at home. 

## Smart Home

After setting up a [Raspberry Pi for the first time](blog/headless-raspberry-pi-setup), I‚Äôm deep into smart home automation.
I‚Äôm learning my way through [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) and I was able to build some cool automations already. 
It‚Äôs nice to see that I can bring my Software Engineer mindset when building these automations and my next step now is to convince the rest of the family that this could be the future.

## Honorable mentions

Three quick mentions from last year I‚Äôm still keeping for 2022 and beyond:

- Choosing [Ireland as our home](/blog/2020-in-review#irish-life) and where we would like to raise our son: super true!
- My personal note about [Learning, growing, failing and trying again](/blog/2020-in-review#learning-growing-failing-and-trying-again): I wouldn‚Äôt change a word of that. It is really important to me and it is part of my life.
- [Atomic Money](https://atomicmoney.app/) is running by itself and I haven't changed it much in 2021. Its mission however keeps untouched: making it easy for you to monitor your income and expenses.

## Looking ahead for 2022

I don't usually plan things in December for the following year.

In fact, I don't agree with life plans once a year. I think it should be a recurrent iteration every now and then.

There's not a well defined recipe that works for everyone but I find it easy to plan ahead sooner and often than later.

For 2022 I want to keep being a leader/mentor, sharing knowledge with my peers (and in this blog) and keep providing for my family. I still think that being a dad is a huge challenge and nobody can teach us how to be a dad, except yourself.

2021 could not be our best, but 2022 is about to begin and we might have another chance to make things great.

Wish you all a happy new year! I see you on the other side.
