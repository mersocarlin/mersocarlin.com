This is another blog post I write about code snippets I find useful (you can check the other blog posts [here](/blog/code-snippets-pre-populate-an-array-in-javascript) and [here](/blog/code-snippets-uniqueid)).
And today's code snippet is about how to get unique values from an array in JavaScript.

I have seen some versions of this snippet before, but the one I like to recommend the most is the use of a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) object alongside with the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) in JavaScript.

By default, a `Set` is meant to store unique values and spreading it into an array is enough to give us the desired result.


```ts
const uniqueArray = arr => [...new Set(arr)]

uniqueArray(['ReactJS', 'NextJS', 'NodeJS', 'ReactJS']) // ['ReactJS', 'NextJS', 'NodeJS']

uniqueArray([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

I hope that's helpful and interesting to you. 👋🏼
