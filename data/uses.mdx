## Misc

- I spent months searching for a backpack I could use for traveling and working. I ended up buying the `PRVKE Series - Black / 31 Liter / Travel Bundle` by [Wandrd](https://eu.wandrd.com/). A bit pricey for a backpack but I absolutely love it!
- I learned how to solve the Rubik's cube in 2015 and never stopped since then. I don't solve it fast enought but I'm happy with my pace. Back in 2016 I got the [Megaminx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx) (12 faced puzzle) as a gift and it made the challenge a bit more fun.
- I have a small collection of Funko Pop in the office. Spider-man and Groot are visible in the picture above but I've got some more.
- There are a few IKEA plants in the office too (_all artificial_). The overall theme is dark and I got convinced I needed a little bit of green too.
